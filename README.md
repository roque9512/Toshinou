==========
A cheat/tool/bot/whatever for a browser flash game named DarkOrbit.
It does some pretty neat stuff and is still under heavy development.
The tool was originally created by freshek, but has been modified and updated by a lot of different people
since freshek abandoned it.  
There's a **HIGH RISK OF BAN**, and i don't recommend you using it on an account you don't want to lose.

If the tool doesn't work, try to use Private mode/Incognito.
Other situations should be reported in [issues](../../issues) (game updates are fine there too).
